## Crawler in Server

We use the pyvirtualdisplay to support the crawler run in server.

The pyvirtualdisplay is a python wrapper for Xvfb, Xephyr and Xvnc.

``` bash
pip install pyvirtualdisplay
```

How to use pyvirtualdisplay:

``` python
from pyvirtualdisplay import Display
display = Display(visible=0, size=(800, 600))
display.start()
# your code here
display.stop()
```
