            "The image appears to be predominantly dark with minimal visible details. There is a faint, elongated shape that could be interpreted as a heat source, possibly a flame, located near the center of the image. However, due to the darkness and lack of clear detail, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the source.\n\nGiven the limited information:\n\n1. **Presence of a heat source or cold source**: There seems to be a faint indication of a heat source.\n2. **Type of heat source or cold source**: The source appears to be a flame-like shape.\n3. **Location of the heat source or cold source**: The source is located near the center of the image.\n4. **Proportion of the heat source or cold source**: It occupies a small portion of the image, approximately 0.1% of the total area.\n\nTherefore, the analysis would be:\n\n{\n  \"source\": \"heat\",\n  \"location\": \"center\",\n  \"proportion\": 0.1\n}"
